## 00_minimal

This is an absolute bare minimum program using go-vk. It simply checks the installed Vulkan version, attempts to create
a Vulkan instance, and then destroys that instance before exiting.

It's only real purpose is to validate that Vulkan and go-vk are actually installed and functional on your system.
