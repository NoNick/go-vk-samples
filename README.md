(TODO)

The "0n_" series of samples follow the project found at [Vulkan-Tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com).

* 01_single_triangle - General Vulkan setup and rendering a single static triangle
* 02_vertex_buffers - Shader input bindings, indexed rendering, staging copying data from the CPU to the GPU
* 03_uniform_buffers - Descriptor sets, uniform buffers, MVP projections
* 04_texture_mapping
* 05_depth_buffering
* 06_loading_models - Loading Wavefront OBJ models from a file (loader TODO)
* 07_generating_mipmaps - Generating, binding and using mipmap textures - TODO - Not yet implemented
* 08_multisampling - TODO - Not yet implemented
* instanced_rendering - Instanced model, repeated N times at different positions, scales, etc. (4k instances?)

Other samples and pending projects:

- Text rendering from TTF using stencils (https://github.com/bbredesen/ttf-renderer)
- glTF model viewer - (https://github.com/bbredesen/gltf-viewer)
- Performance test? Rendering 10K, 100K, 1M, 10M poly scenes?
- Extension demos and testing?
- Compute shaders - Preculling a large scene?
